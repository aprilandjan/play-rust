# play-rust

A beginner's rust-lang exploration :)

## add dependencies

```bash
$ cargo add ferris-says
```

## build & run

```bash
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```

## Thoughts

1. No need to write parentheses in `if` `for` control flow statement
2. Can still use `return something;` if we want
3. Seems that there's no builtin random generator, had to use crate `rand` to do that([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19671845/how-can-i-generate-a-random-number-within-a-range-in-rust))
4. Seems that is is very hard to create a recursive closure?([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16946888/is-it-possible-to-make-a-recursive-closure-in-rust))
