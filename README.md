# play-rust

A beginner's rust-lang exploration :)

## Thoughts

1. No need to write parentheses in `if` `for` control flow statement
2. Can still use `return something;` if we want
3. Seems that there's no builtin random generator, had to use crate `rand` to do that([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19671845/how-can-i-generate-a-random-number-within-a-range-in-rust))
